|                   | `visibility_mode`   | `ALWAYS` visible or `WHEN_TOUCHED`.                                         |

|                   | `tip_limit_circle`  | Maximum range of joystick movement.                                         |
|                   | `touch_detection_region` | Area where touch input is detected.                             |
| **Response**      | `strength_curve`    | Customize input strength translation.                                       |
| **Mapping**       | `left_movement`     | Action name for leftward movement.                                          |
|                   | `right_movement`    | Action name for rightward movement.                                         |

|                   | `down_movement`     | Action name for downward movement.                                          |

## Recommended Project Settings

For optimal functionality, adjust the following settings in your Godot project:

- **"Emulate Touch from Mouse"**: ON
- **"Emulate Mouse from Touch"**: OFF

These settings ensure proper touch input handling, especially when testing on desktop environments.

## Usage Tips

- Add the joystick as a child of a **CanvasLayer** for proper rendering on top of other elements.
- Experiment with different **strength_curve** settings to find the right feel for your game.
- Use the **DYNAMIC** joystick_mode for more flexible controls in different game scenarios.
- Adjust the **deadzone_circle** to prevent unintended small movements.
- Customize the **touch_detection_region** to create larger or smaller interactive areas.

## Example Code

Here's a simple example of how to read input from the joystick in your game logic:

```gdscript
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    direction = Input.get_vector("ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_up", "ui_down", 0)
    position += direction * speed * delta
```
